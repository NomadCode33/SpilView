## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** ArcGIS Pro

The project started with a basic map of the world in a WGS84 coordinate system, displayed in black and gray tones. The initial map had a cartoonish level of generalization, intended to balance detail with clarity on a small-scale map.

My first step was to change the map projection to highlight the interconnectedness of the world's oceans using the "Spilhaus World Ocean Map in a Square." I zoomed to the full extent of the map and opened the Map Properties dialog box. In the Coordinate Systems tab, I searched for and selected the Spilhaus projection. This projection uniquely presents the world's oceans as a singular, continuous body of water, offering a fresh perspective.

Next, I focused on creating a layout that visually prioritized the oceans and employed an attractive faded border to frame the ocean composition. I created a new layout with a custom page size of 1000x1000 points, giving me a square canvas to work with. I added the Spilhaus map to the layout, adjusting the map frame properties to remove the default border and ensure the map filled the space correctly.

To avoid abrupt edges and ensure continuity, I duplicated the map frame four times, placing copies along the edges of the central map. I rotated these frames as necessary to align perfectly with the central map, creating a seamless, repeating pattern that maintained the geographic continuity of areas like the Gulf of Mexico.

To enhance the map's visual appeal, I added a vignette overlay image with a black mask, providing a pleasant faded edge that helped focus the viewer's attention on the oceans. This choice added contrast and depth to the map.

Adding color was the next step to make the map truly unique. I selected a green color for the land polygons, giving the map a vibrant look. For the bathymetry, I chose a blue color scheme to represent oceanic depths, making the map more visually engaging and informative. Finally, I added text, titles, and other essential information to complete the layout.

Through this process, I transformed a simple, black-and-gray map into a visually stunning and informative representation of the world's oceans, using advanced GIS techniques and creative design choices to tell a compelling story. This project taught me the importance of thoughtful projection selection, the power of repetition for visual continuity, and the impact of color and overlay techniques in creating engaging maps.
